# Analyzing ab test results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, 
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Technology and Tools Used
The analysis was done using python via a Juptyer notebook and the following packages were used to assists with data wrangling,
data cleaning as well as data visualisation so as to come to a conclusion.
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* statsmodels.api
* scipy.stats
* timeit


## Datasets.

Attached are two csv files, countries.csv which contains information on users based on the countries they visited the website on and ab_data.csv which contains information linked to the old as well as new e-commerce website. The csv files have been uploaded and there will be a brief description in the jupyter python notebook.

# Conclusion

Afetr the completion of the analysis based on the data it seems the new web page has no impact on conversion rate.
